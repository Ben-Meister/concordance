This software is still in beta. That means it's UI isn't the easiest to use
yet and will be changing.

However, in the meantime, you generally use the software in one of the
following ways:

0. I got a file from the website, do something useful with it.

  $ sudo harmony <filename>

This will attempt to figure out what to do, and do it.

1. Backup the config

  $ sudo harmony --config

This will read the config off of your remote and write it to Update.EZHex.
It's a good tool for development as well as backing up your config. This can
however be created from the members.harmony.com website.

2. Write a config

Once you have downloaded a file from members.harmony.com website to program
your remote with, you can use it with:

  $ sudo harmony --config --write Update.EZHex

3. Backup the firmware

  $ sudo harmony --firmware

This will read teh firmware off of your remote and write it to fimrware.EZHex.
See "1. Backup the config" for more information.

4. Write firmware

NOTE: THIS IS NOT YET SUPPORTED. However it would work like this:

  $ sudo harmony --firmware --write Firmware.EZHex


There are other options - check out the --help one!

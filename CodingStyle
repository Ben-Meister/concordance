INDENTATION
Concordance currently uses tab-character indentation. While 4- or 8-space
indentation would be preferrable, it's not what we have now, so please keep
the existing indentation.


PAGE-WIDTH
Page-width should not be wider than 80 characters. If they are, you've nested
your functions too deep and you need to re-factor your code. There are
occasional execptions to this where something like a static_cast of a variable
with a long name to a type with a long name may cause one line to be too long
while everything else is fine. But this should be the exception, not the rule.


SPACING
We follow the K&R coding style. You should familiarize yourself with it.
Additional specifics follow.

Spaces are important. All operators should be surrounded by a space on either
side, such as "i == 2" instead of "i==2".

Parynthesis and brackets do not need spaces inside them. In otherwords you
should have:
   if (i == 2) {

and not:
   if ( i == 2 ) {

The same thing for i[2] as opposed to i[ 2 ].


CROSS-PLATFORM NOTES
Code MUST be portable and cross-platform. Our codebase works on Linux, Mac OS
X, BSD, Windows, and possibly others. As such it is important ensure any
patches are cross-platform.

Contributors are not expected to be familiar with all supported platforms, but
should be willing to modify and re-submit patches in response to feedback from
developers and other contributors regarding cross-platform issues.

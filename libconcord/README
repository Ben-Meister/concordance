This software is still in beta. That means it's UI isn't the easiest to use
yet and will be changing.

However, in the meantime, you generally use the software in one of the
following ways:

0. I got a file from the website, do something useful with it.

  $ sudo harmony <filename>

This will attempt to figure out what to do, and do it. Note that harmony uses
the *filename* to figure out what to do with it, so don't rename it. This
option is designed for associating the .EZHex extension in your browser with
the harmony software. Of course, this requires your desktop environment to
support someway of getting harmony root access such as gksu or similar, but
should allow the same seemless process the Logitech software does. If you
would prefer to rename it, tell harmony what you need done using one of it's
many options...

1. Backup the config

  $ sudo harmony --dump-config=/tmp/config.EZHex

This will read the config off of your remote and write it to /tmp/config.EZHex.
It's a good tool for development as well as backing up your config. This can
however be created from the members.harmonyremote.com website. The equals
is needed if you pass in a filename since the filename is optional. If
you don't specify, harmony will use 'config.EZHex' in the current directory.

2. Write a config

Once you have downloaded a file from members.harmony.com website to program
your remote with, you can use it with:

  $ sudo harmony --write-config Update.EZHex

3. Backup the firmware

  $ sudo harmony --dump-firmware

This will read the firmware off of your remote and write it to fimrware.EZHex.
See "1. Backup the config" for more information.

4. Write firmware

NOTE: THIS IS NOT YET SUPPORTED. However it would work like this:

  $ sudo harmony --write-firmware Firmware.EZHex


There are other options - check out the --help one!

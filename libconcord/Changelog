CVS
Released:
phil@ipom.com
- split into library and CLI
- formalize API
- document API
- convert to autoconf/automake/libtool
- add firmware update to library and cli
- cleanup output throughout libharmony code
- compilation fixes for Mac
- kext for Mac
- rename from harmony to concord
- ignore return value from reset_remote() since it doesn't always return
  successfully from all remotes (thanks to linux@zachcarter.com)
- fix the location and name of the license file (thanks to
  s-t-concordance@wwwdotorg.org)
- Add CodingStyle and SubmittingPatches documentation
- Update auto-mode to understand firmware updates
- Make concordance be able to handle the remote having an invalid config
  so that we can fix it
- Implement new libconcord debug() macro and unify the code to use that
  instead of tons of #ifdefs
- Re-order functions in libconcord.cpp to make more sense
- Replace all read_*_from_file() APIs with Andreas' _read_from_file()
  function, renaming it read_file()
- Restructure code-flow in concordance to read a file very early
  with read_file(), and then pass around the data as needed. Both for
  cleanup and to prep for an libconcord API to detect filetype better
- Make libconcord submit HID data without an initial 0-byte that a
  Windows HID stack would expect. In the event we're using WinHID,
  our WinHID code will add the extra 0-byte, but the rest of the code
  is no longer encumbered with it.
- Perl bindings for libconcord
